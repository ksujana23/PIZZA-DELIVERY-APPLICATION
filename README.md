# 🍕 Slice & Co. — Pizza Delivery Application

A full-stack pizza ordering web application built using **React, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB** that allows users to browse pizzas, build custom pizzas, simulate payments, and track orders in real time.

This project was developed as a **Level 3 Full Stack Web Development Project** inspired by a Pizza Delivery Application workflow.
